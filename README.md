# Proposal-to-NASA-
Lab 08 of CMPE 460L

The project idea to help NASA involves the problem of a limited fund for NASA's space exploration. Currently NASA relys on tax money to fund its exploration of space. 
To solve this problem I'm proposing NASA starts manufacturing quality cars, since NASA has a lot of top level engineers. 

The technologies needed will be the manufacturing tools to build motors and other car parts, which NASA already has experinence with. In addtion, to a marketing team and a business team and most importantly the engineers.

To start this project NASA will have to find an initial funding for manufacturing cars after this first investment the project will fund itself.
Next NASA should allocate its human resuorces such as the engineers and others to work partly on developing these cars. 
Lastly, they should start a arketing campaign for their car and encourage space enthusist to purchase their cars as it will help in the progress of space exploration.
