Today i learned a lot about GitHub and its uses. I was surprised with the features of tracking changes and how it enables you to keep
original codes and files safe before making any changes and allowing peers to review the changes before adding them to your main files and codes.
I can see how this makes collaboration on coding and files much more organised and professional. Learning creating branches was challenging at the begining because
I did not understand get the idea at first, but after reading the slides it became very clear and easy.
If I had time I would try to develop a mini application or a coding project on GitHub to fully experience it.
